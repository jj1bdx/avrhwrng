# Hardware Random Number Generator for Arduino

This repository contains a sample code with avr-gcc and the schematics
for a shield (extended piece of hardware) for Arduino Duemilanove.

Note: the code is *not* written in the Arduino programming framework; it
is written in C and avr-libc at <http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/>.

## Changes

7-MAR-2009: Code tested under AVR Studio 4.15 with WinAVR-20081205.
